const solution = (a) => {
    // Write your solution

    return "your solution";
};

const info = () => {
    console.log(`
    This snack will receive one input:
        - one array of numbers (a)


    From the following example you should be able to understand how to implement a solution:

    Input:          | Output:
    [1,2,3,4]       | 20

    Input:          | Output:
    [5,5]           | 20

    Input:          | Output:
    [3,5,7]         | 30

    Input:          | Output:
    [100,200]       | 600 
    `);
};

export default { solution: solution, info: info };
