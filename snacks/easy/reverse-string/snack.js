    This snack will receive two inputs:
        - a number (n)
        - a string (s)


    From the following example you should be able to understand how to implement a solution:

    Input:          | Output:
    1               | !dlroW olleH
    Hello World!    |

    Input:          | Output:
    0               | Nice game
    Nice game       |

    Input:          | Output:
    20              | Really?
    Really?         |

    Input:          | Output:
    201             | melborp oN
    No problem      |
    `);

export default { solution: solution, info: info };
