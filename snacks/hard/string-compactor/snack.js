const solution = (s) => {
    // Write your solution

    return "your solution";
};

const info = () => {
    console.log(`
    This snack will receive one input:
        - one string (s)


    From the following example you should be able to understand how to implement a solution:

    Input:                                                | Output:
    easy                                                  | e1a1s1y1

    Input:                                                | Output:
    stuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck                                  | s1t1u16c1k1

    Input:                                                | Output:
    keyyyyyyboaaaaarrrd                                   | k1e1y6b1o1a5r3d1

    Input:                                                | Output:
    kkkkkeyboard nnnnot       workinggggg                 | k5e1y1b1o1a1r1d1 1n4o1t1 7w1o1r1k1i1n1g5

    Input:                                                | Output:
    122333444455555666666                                 | 112233445566 
    `);
};

export default { solution: solution, info: info };
